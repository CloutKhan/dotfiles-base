# This is an extensible ssh config. It "includes" a config extension prior to
# and after whatever the shared config is sandwiched between these includes.

# HOWEVER, ssh's include directive does not necessarily behave the same as
# some other includes used in other configs here. GENERALLY speaking, if you
# want to "override" a setting, you should add it to the PRE includes, as most
# values are SET ONCE and not changed later on. POST includes is available in
# case there is a use case for it, e.g. adding wild card hosts in pre or here,
# and refining them into "less wild card"-y hosts in post. But for overrides,
# you'll want to use pre. A note of caution though is that the IdentityFile does
# not override or block overrides, it is cumulative, and each one will be tried!

# Includes will work and fail silently if the file is missing post 7.3p1 --
# Try 'ssh -V' or 'ssh -v localhost' to see your version if this doesn't work,
# but it's >9 years old by now so unless your system is ancient, you're fine.

# The intent of adding this is to transition from my long term gist that I keep
# https://gist.github.com/Skenvy/8e16d4f044707e63c670f5b487da02c0 to remember
# how to set up ssh+gpg without config, to one that plans to allow for checking
# in the ssh and gpg configs, as part of planning to use devcontainers.
# https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/sharing-git-credentials
# It is also a generic enough entry to warrant adding to main.
