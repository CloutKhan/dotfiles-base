# This is an extensible ssh config. It "includes" a config extension prior to
# and after whatever the shared config is sandwiched between these includes.

# HOWEVER, ssh's include directive requires awareness of how it operates!
# GENERALLY speaking, to "override" a setting, you add it to the PRE includes.
# Values are SET ONCE and not changed later on. POST includes is used for adding
# wild card hosts in pre or here, then refining them into "less wild card"-y
# hosts in post. Some fields like IdentityFile don't override or block overrides
# but rather, are cumulative, and each one will be tried!

# 'Includes' will work and fail silently if the file is missing post 7.3p1 --
# Try 'ssh -V' or 'ssh -v localhost' to see your version if this doesn't work,
# but it's >9 years old by now so unless your system is ancient, you're fine.
