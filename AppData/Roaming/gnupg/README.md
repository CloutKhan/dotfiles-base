# Windows GPG Config
_This_ directory (`%APPDATA%/gnupg`) is where the Windows version of gpg will
keep its config. You can install it from the "Simple installer for the current
GnuPG" option on https://www.gnupg.org/download/ under Windows versions.

For more information, see the main gpg README [here](../../../.gnupg/README.md).
